## General info
This is a final exam project. This is my first web project where I have been learning how to use HTML and CSS and putting it in concrete use. This is far from being a complete website. It is a prototype which is to have features. There are buttons which link to 5 other tabs. There are still features to be added (navbar for footer e.g).
