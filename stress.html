          <div class="title3">Our Stress Manegment Strategies</div>
          <div class="subheading">The fastest way to relieve stress</div>
          <div class="text3">1. Recognize when you’re stressed</div>
          <div class="text3_1">It’s very important for one to recognize when you’re expericening stress, this is not very common today because many people almost live in a frazzled state every day. Which means that you forget what it feels like when your nervous systems are in balance. You yourself have to listen to your body, for example when you’re tired, your eyes feel heavy or when you’re happy and laugh easily. It’s important to get in the habit of paying attention to your body’s clues.</div>
          <div class="text4">2. Identify your stress response</div>
          <div class="text4_1">Inside us we will all respond the same way to the “fight-or-flight” stress response: our blood pressure rises, our heart pumps faster, and our muscles constrict. Your body works hard and drains your immune system. The difference is outside, externally, where people respond to stress in different ways. We have found that the best way to quickly relieve stress often relates to your specific stress response: People with “Overexcited stress response”: If you tend to become angry, agitated, overly emotional, or keyed up under stress, the best respond for you to relief stress will be to do activities that quit you down. People with “Underexcited stress response”: If you tend to become depressed, withdrawn, or spaced out under stress, the best way for you to respond will be stress relief acitivities that are stimulating and energizing.</div>
          <div class="text5">3. Use your senses to quickly relieve stress</div>
          <div class="text5_1">All your six senses has an important part in many different or similiar ways in your life. And your senses can be used to quickly relieve stress you carry. What requires from you is to experiment how your body and stress levels drop, when you employ different senses. For an example, if you’re a music lover, listen to many diiferent artists and types of music until you find the song that instantly lifts and relaxes you. Every person has a different response, which is why it’s important for one to try your senses to truly find one that makes you relaxed and even lowers your stress level. And of course, to remind you the six senses are: sight, smell, sound, movement, touch and taste. If you believe you are having trouble identifying sensory techniques that actually help you. Try instead sensory inspiration, that can be from your sights during your day to memories from your past. You can use as said your memories to find a certain level of relax and stress relieve, or to simply watch others to observe and learn how others deal with stress, which can give you valueable insights. Another one is the power of your imagination. This strategy can be used in many ways, one way we that we believe that this will work is once you have drawn your sensory toolbox and made it into a habit. You yourself can then try simply imagining vivid sensations when stress strikes. When you can recall a strong sensation, you’ll be able to quickly be able to fight any stress attack you experience.</div>
          <div class="text6">4. Make quick stress relief a habit in your life</div>
          <div class="text6_1">It isn’t easy to remember to use your senses when experiencing any form of crisis. It is easier for one to just give into pressure and tense. But, we believe with time you will be familiar with the usage of your senses during your daily life, which will become second nature for you. This process that has been explained to you is not just practicing/learning the skills for one lesson, it’s a long process much like learning to drive or playing football. As said before learn the skills and tools till you feel that it both helps you and also becomes second nature for you. With all the points above learned and mastered you will be able to fight for your mental and psycholgical health during challenging times.</div>
